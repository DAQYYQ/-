随着国家教育事业的发展，提升教师阅卷速度与效率迫在眉睫，为了实现选择题阅卷的自动化，本课题设计了一种基于摄像头的答题卡自动阅卷器，通过在STM32F103芯片板上面安装摄像头拍摄答题卡，将图片存入SD卡并通过读卡器将信息传入PC端，PC端使用MATLAB进行图像处理与分析，与正确答案进行分析匹配，从而识别学号与手写的A、B、C、D选项并计算出成绩。

With the reform of national education, it is urgent to improve the speed and efficiency of paper marking. In order to realize the automatic marking of the multiple choice, a camera-based answer card automatic reader is design in the paper. 
Based on a camera installed on the STM32F103 chip board, the image of the answer shit could be photographed and then transmitted to PC through the card reader. The PC uses MATLAB to process and analyze the image to match the correct answer. In order to identify the student number and handwritten A, B, C, D options and calculate the score.
